# clustering
In this program we allocate the students to a study centre such that each student i s alloted to study centre nearby.Here there is no 
repetition or multiple allocation of students to a single study centre.

Initially we allocate the students to a study centre based on distance factor i,e the distance between the student's residential and the
study centre.Once the study centre is allocated the next step is calculation of centroid which is the mean of the values.This calculation 
of centroid and allocation of students to a study centre continues until the values stabilize.

In this way students are allocated to a study centre in an effecient manner.
